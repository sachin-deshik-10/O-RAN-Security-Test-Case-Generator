        "threat_description": "xApps in the Near-RT-RIC have the capability to manipulate behavior of a certain cell, a group of UEs, and a specific UE. A malfunctioning or unavailable root of trust could potentially cause issues on the network and compromise RAN performance, privacy, etc. For example, the xApp could track a certain subscriber or impact service for a subscriber or a dedicated area. In addition, an xApp can receive order via A1 to control a certain UE and if a malfunctioning xApp receives an order to prioritize this UE, then the owner of the malfunctioning xApp knows a VIP that they want to track is in a certain area. With this command exposure, the attacker can obtain a rough location of a very important person and change the order from prioritize to deprioritize for a UE. Further, E2 interface exposes UE identification that can be exploited by a malicious xApp. As the E2 interface (similar to A1 interface) can point out a certain UE in the network, this will create a correlation between the randomized (anonymized) UE identities between the RAN nodes. For example, a xApp can potentially be used as a “sniffer” for UE identification. The additional challenge for the Near-RT RIC / E2 compared to the Non-RT RIC / A1 is that more frequent signaling is expected over the E2 interface to enable near-real-time operation. Therefore, the UE identifier will be exchanged more frequently over the E2 than over the A1.",

        "threat_description": "Not mutually authenticating xApps and Near-RT RIC platform APIs could potentially allow attackers to perform the following type of attacks: Operating malicious xApp claiming to be genuine in order to request certain services (theft of services) or information (data leakage), Man in the middle attacks between a genuine xApp and a Near-RT RIC platform API, Querying network or UE information from a compromised xApp to Near-RT RIC platform (e.g. database via SDL API), thereby leaking potentially sensitive data about network and/or UE (potential privacy issues), Subscribing a malicious xApp to services provided by the Near-RT RIC platform, such as API-related events notifications, discovery of APIs, E2SM, etc. The use of weak credentials in the process of API authentication can compromise the overall system. The user/password combination isn’t considered safe, not only for password related attacks (e.g., brute-force), but also it would represent a high risk to allow xApps, especially 3rd party xApps, to store the user/password combo. This approach would extend the attack surface into xApps side. As a reference, OWASP API Security Top 10 report [26]  indicates that authentication mechanisms are often implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise authentication tokens or to exploit implementation flaws to assume other user's identities temporarily or permanently. Compromising system's ability to identify the client/user, compromises API security overall.",

As a reference, OWASP API Security Top 10 report [26] indicates that ‘Broken Object Level Authorization’ has been the most common and impactful attack on APIs. Even if the application implements a proper infrastructure for authorization checks, developers might forget to use these checks before accessing a sensitive object. Unauthorized access can result in data disclosure to unauthorized parties, data loss, or data manipulation. In the actual context of Near-RT RIC [27], the platform as API producer shall be responsible to specify those rights/privileges for the platform services as resources to the xApps as consumers. In general, an xApp should only have the required set of permissions to perform the actions for which they are authorized, and no more. Note.
